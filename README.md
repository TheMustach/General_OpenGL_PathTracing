https://github.com/TheMustach/General_OpenGL_PathTracing 


A high-performance path tracer implementation designed for realistic rendering of 3D scenes using physically accurate lighting and shading. This project supports advanced rendering techniques such as global illumination, ray tracing, and material-based light interactions.

Features
Physically Accurate Rendering: Simulates realistic light transport.
Global Illumination: Full support for indirect lighting.
Materials: Supports diffuse, glossy, and reflective materials.
Performance Optimization: Multi-threading and acceleration structures.
Custom Scenes: Easily define and render custom 3D scenes.
